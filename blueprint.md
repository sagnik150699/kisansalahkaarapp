# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and features of the Flutter application. It serves as a guide for development and a record of the app's capabilities.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by feature, with each feature having its own `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` layers. The core of the application is in the `lib` folder, with the main entry point being `lib/main.dart`.

## Style and Design

The application uses a modern and visually appealing design, with a consistent theme and a focus on user experience. The theme is defined in `lib/core/theme.dart`, and the main colors are a deep purple and a light blue. The app is responsive and works well on both mobile and web.

## Features

### Implemented Features

*   **Crop Recommendations:** Provides crop recommendations based on various factors.
*   **Government Schemes:** Displays a list of government schemes for farmers.
*   **Pest and Disease Detection:** Helps identify and manage crop pests and diseases.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Allows the user to switch between light and dark themes.

### Current Task

*   **Fix project problems:** The current task is to fix any problems in the project, including dependency issues and analysis errors. I have already updated the dependencies and fixed the versioning issues in `pubspec.yaml`. There are no more analysis errors.
